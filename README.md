Uploaded to Github: 11/18/23

Python program that performs newton's interpolation on a large set of points.
Retrieves derivative values and creates a function that accurately resembles the point set.
Is able to print out function y-output when asked for a given x-input value. 

Also includes program 'refill.py' that rerandomizes the point set, which prompts the user for the number of points that should be inputed.
